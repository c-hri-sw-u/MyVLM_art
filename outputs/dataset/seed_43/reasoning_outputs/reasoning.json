The scene is set in a field of golden grass, with a few trees dotting the landscape. The brushwork is characterized by thick, swirling lines and bold, vibrant colors, particularly noticeable in the use of yellow and blue. The palette is dominated by these two colors, with the yellow grass contrasting sharply against the blue of the sky and the trees. The composition is dynamic, with the trees and grass creating a sense of depth",
